<questions>
1.What are the MVP’s top-level views and routes?
Recommendation: Use /generate, /generations, /generations/:id, /flashcards, /flashcards/:id (modal), /study, /auth/login, /auth/register, /settings/account; protect app routes via middleware and redirect unauthenticated users to /auth/login.
2.How should the Generate view enforce input constraints, show progress, and indicate cached results?
Recommendation: Enforce 1,000–10,000 chars with live counter and disabled submit; show indeterminate loader with elapsed time; display a “Cached” badge when "cached": true, plus generated_count and duration.
3.Should proposal acceptance be per-card or batch, and how do we tag edited vs unedited for POST /api/flashcards?
Recommendation: Support per-card accept/reject with inline edit; batch “Save selected” submits multiple POSTs, setting source to ai-full or ai-edited and including generation_id; persist unsaved selections locally.
4.What list controls are needed for Flashcards (GET /api/flashcards)?
Recommendation: Provide page/limit, source filter, optional generation_id filter, and sort by created/updated; reflect state in URL params; consume RFC5988 Link headers when present.
5.Should editing/deleting a flashcard use a modal or dedicated page?
Recommendation: Use a modal drawer over the list for quick edits; apply optimistic PUT/DELETE with rollback on error; require confirm for DELETE and show a brief success toast.
6.What should the Generations list/detail display and how should it link to flashcards?
Recommendation: List shows model, created_at, source_text_length, generated_count, duration; detail shows proposals summary and accepted flashcards with link to /flashcards?generation_id=....
7.How will the Study Session source its scheduled cards given no dedicated endpoints?
Recommendation: For MVP, run the SRS client-side on user’s flashcards and store scheduling fields in the same resource; if needed, add minimal endpoints/fields later, but don’t block UI on server scheduling.
8.What client state/data fetching strategy should we adopt?
Recommendation: Use TanStack Query for all API calls with keys mirroring endpoint + params; persist cache to sessionStorage; use optimistic updates for PUT/DELETE and invalidate queries on success.
9.How should API errors and rate limits be surfaced in the UI?
Recommendation: Normalize on the API’s error schema; show inline field errors for 422, toast for generic errors, and a retry-after countdown for 429 using rate-limit headers; add a global error boundary.
10.What design system, responsiveness, accessibility, and i18n choices apply?
Recommendation: Use Shadcn/ui + Tailwind with a shared theme (light/dark), responsive grid for cards, keyboard navigation, labeled inputs, aria-live toasts, focus states, and Polish-first i18n with English-ready keys.

1. Auth screen, dashboard, generations screen, flashcards list screen (with a modal to edit a flashcard and a button to delete a flashcard), and user panel.

2. Enforce **1,000–10,000 characters** with a live counter and disabled submit when out of range; show an indeterminate loader with elapsed time during generation; include `generated_count` and `duration` in the response. There is no caching in the current design, so I’m not sure what was meant by “display a **Cached** badge when `cached: true`.”

3. Support per-card **accept / reject** with inline edit. Batch “Save selected” should submit multiple POSTs, setting `source` to `ai-full` or `ai-edited` and including `generation_id`. Persist unsaved selections locally (client-side).

4. Recommendation: provide pagination (`page`/`limit`), a `source` filter, an optional `generation_id` filter, and sorting by `created` / `updated`. Reflect state in URL params and consume RFC5988 `Link` headers when present.

5. Recommendation: use a modal/drawer over the list for quick edits; apply optimistic `PUT`/`DELETE` with rollback on error; require confirmation for `DELETE` and show a brief success toast.

6. The generations list is out of scope for the MVP — I will return to it in a later iteration.

7. For MVP, run the SRS (spaced-repetition) client-side on the user’s flashcards and store scheduling fields in the same resource. Add minimal endpoints/fields later if needed, but don’t block the UI on server-side scheduling.

8. For now we will use the built-in React state mechanisms (hooks + React Context). No additional caching is required.

9. Normalize on the API’s error schema: show inline field errors for `422`, show a toast for generic errors, and show a retry-after countdown for `429` using rate-limit headers. Add a global error boundary.

10. Use `shadcn/ui` + Tailwind with a shared theme (light/dark). Implement a responsive grid for cards, keyboard navigation, labeled inputs, `aria-live` toasts, visible focus states, and Polish-first i18n with English-ready keys.

<questions>
1.Should “Generations screen” mean only the Generate view (no history) for MVP?
Recommendation: Yes—implement only a Generate view on the dashboard; omit generation history/routes until a later iteration.
2.How should we count and validate input length for generation (trim/whitespace/newlines)?
Recommendation: Count after trimming; normalize whitespace/newlines; enforce 1,000–10,000 with live counter, disabled submit, and unload-warning; autosave draft to localStorage (debounced).
3.What is the expected max number of AI proposals and required list behaviors?
Recommendation: Aim for ≤50 proposals; support per-card accept/reject, inline edit, “Select all,” and keyboard shortcuts (A accept, R reject, E edit, S save); persist selection in Context + localStorage.
4.How should batch “Save selected” handle failures and duplicates?
Recommendation: Submit sequentially with progress; mark ai-edited if edited, else ai-full, include generation_id; deduplicate by normalized front+back; retry failed items individually and report a concise summary.
5.What are the Flashcards list defaults for paging, sorting, and filters?
Recommendation: Default limit=20, sort by -created_at; filters for source and optional generation_id; reflect state in URL; read RFC5988 Link headers when present; use classic pagination (not infinite scroll).
6.How should the edit modal handle concurrency and destructive actions?
Recommendation: Fetch current card on open and compare updated_at; if mismatch, prompt to refresh/merge; require confirm for DELETE; use optimistic updates with rollback and an optional short “Undo” toast.
7.What initial SRS fields and review flow should the Study Session use?
Recommendation: Use client-only dueAt, interval, ease, streak; three-button grading; persist session progress locally for MVP; defer server fields/endpoints to a later iteration.
8.Where should we centralize UI state without a data-fetching library?
Recommendation: Create lightweight AuthContext, ProposalsContext, and an Api helper (abort, retries, JSON/error normalization); keep per-view state local; no background prefetch or caching beyond in-memory and localStorage drafts.
9.How should authentication and route protection work across SSR/CSR?
Recommendation: Protect /app/* via Astro middleware using Supabase session; on API 401, attempt token refresh then redirect to /auth/login; gate protected views behind an auth guard with a small loading state.
10.What accessibility, theming, and i18n conventions should be standardized?
Recommendation: Use Shadcn/ui Dialog/Drawer/Toast/Pagination with Tailwind; ensure focus traps, visible focus, and aria-live toasts; Polish default i18n via i18next (English-ready keys); system light/dark with in-app toggle.

1.Yes — implement only the Generate view on the dashboard; omit generation history and related routes until a later iteration.

2.Count characters after trimming and normalizing whitespace/newlines. Enforce the 1,000–10,000 range with a live counter, disabled submit button, and unload warning. Autosave drafts to localStorage (debounced).

3.Limit to ≤10 proposals. Support per-card accept/reject, inline edit, and “Select all.”

4.Submit sequentially with progress tracking. Mark as ai-edited if edited, otherwise as ai-full. Include generation_id. Deduplicate by normalized front + back. Retry failed items individually and display a concise summary.

5.Use limit=20 by default and sort by -created_at. Provide filters for source and optional generation_id. Reflect state in the URL. Read RFC5988 Link headers when present. Use classic pagination (not infinite scroll).

6.No need for additional handling — just attempt deletion with an optimistic update.

7.The study session is out of scope for the MVP.

8.Manage UI state using React hooks and React Context.

9.Protect /app/* routes via Astro middleware using the Supabase session. On API 401, attempt a token refresh; if it fails, redirect to /auth/login. Gate protected views behind an auth guard with a small loading state.

10.Use shadcn/ui (Dialog, Drawer, Toast, Pagination) with Tailwind CSS. Ensure focus traps, visible focus states, and aria-live toasts. Implement Polish as the default i18n via i18next (English-ready keys). Support system light/dark mode with an in-app toggle.
