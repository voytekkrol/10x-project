This plan outlines the development of a single-page application that generates 5-10 flashcards from user-provided text (1000-10000 characters) using OpenRouter.ai's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The application will be built with Astro, React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components.

1. Environment and Configuration Setup

Add VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable to the .env file for OpenRouter.ai API access
Verify all necessary dependencies are already installed (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components)
Confirm the Astro configuration supports client-side React components with the client:load directive
2. Type Definitions and Data Models

Create a TypeScript types file at src/types/flashcard.ts defining:
Flashcard interface with id, question, and answer properties
GenerationStatus type for tracking loading states (idle, loading, success, error)
ApiResponse interface for the OpenRouter.ai response structure
3. API Integration Layer

Create an API utility file at src/lib/openrouter.ts containing:
Function to communicate with OpenRouter.ai API endpoint (https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)
Configuration to use the openai/gpt-3.5-turbo model
Prompt engineering function that instructs the LLM to generate exactly 5-10 question-answer pairs in strict JSON array format
Request headers including Authorization with API key, HTTP-Referer, and X-Title
Response parsing logic to extract and validate the JSON array of flashcards
Comprehensive error handling for network failures, API errors, and invalid responses
4. Input Validation Utilities

Create a validation utility file at src/lib/validation.ts containing:
Function to check if text length is between 1000-10000 characters
Function to return user-friendly validation error messages
Character count display helper that shows current/max characters
5. Core React Components

Create FlashcardGenerator.tsx as the main interactive component at src/components/FlashcardGenerator.tsx:

Manage state for input text, character count, generated flashcards, loading status, and error messages
Import shadcn/ui components (Textarea, Button, Card, Alert)
Implement real-time character counter showing current count and min/max limits
Validate input before allowing generation (disable button if text is outside 1000-10000 range)
Handle form submission and API calls with proper async/await error handling
Display loading state with spinner during generation
Render the list of generated flashcards after successful API response
Show validation and API error messages using Alert component
Create FlashcardItem.tsx component at src/components/FlashcardItem.tsx:

Display individual flashcard using shadcn/ui Card component
Show question prominently at the top with bold or larger text
Show answer below with clear visual separation
Use consistent spacing and typography
Add subtle hover effects for interactivity
Create FlashcardList.tsx component at src/components/FlashcardList.tsx:

Accept array of flashcards as props
Display "Suggested Flashcards" heading with count (e.g., "Suggested Flashcards (7)")
Map through flashcards and render FlashcardItem components in a responsive grid
Show empty state when no flashcards exist
Add smooth fade-in animation when flashcards appear
6. User Interface Layout

Update src/pages/index.astro to include:
Professional page title: "10x-Cards - AI Flashcard Generator"
Hero section with application name and tagline
Brief instructions explaining the 1000-10000 character requirement
Integration of FlashcardGenerator component with client:load directive
Responsive container with proper max-width for readability
Consistent padding and margins throughout
7. State Management and User Flow

Implement client-side state management in FlashcardGenerator component:
Text input state tracking user's pasted content
Character count state updating in real-time as user types
Generated flashcards array state (empty by default)
Loading boolean state for API calls
Error message string state for validation and API errors
Create complete user interaction flow:
User sees large textarea with placeholder text explaining the feature
Character counter displays below textarea showing "0 / 1000 minimum, 10000 maximum"
"Generate Flashcards" button is disabled when text is outside valid range
Button becomes enabled when character count is between 1000-10000
User clicks enabled button to trigger generation
Loading spinner appears with message "Generating flashcards..."
Upon success, "Suggested Flashcards" section appears with 5-10 cards
Upon error, Alert component shows specific error message
User can modify text and generate again without page refresh
Page refresh clears all state (no persistence in PoC)
8. Styling and Visual Design

Apply Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern design:
Mobile-first responsive layout (single column on mobile, optimal width on desktop)
Proper spacing using Tailwind spacing scale (p-4, p-6, p-8, etc.)
Professional color scheme using blue or teal accent colors
Clean white/gray background with subtle gradients
Style the textarea:
Large input area with minimum height of 300px
Monospace or readable font
Placeholder text: "Paste your text here (1000-10000 characters). The AI will generate 5-10 flashcards based on key concepts..."
Border styling that changes on focus
Style character counter:
Display below textarea in small, subtle text
Turn red when below minimum or above maximum
Turn green when in valid range
Style flashcard displays:
Grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 2-3 columns desktop)
Card component with shadow and border
Question in bold or semibold with larger font
Answer in regular weight below question
Consistent padding inside cards
Gap between cards in grid
9. Error Handling and User Feedback

Implement validation errors:
"Text must be at least 1000 characters" when too short
"Text must not exceed 10000 characters" when too long
Display using shadcn/ui Alert component with warning variant
Implement API error handling:
Network errors: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection."
API key errors: "API configuration error. Please contact support."
Rate limit errors: "Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again."
Invalid response errors: "Failed to generate flashcards. Please try again."
Provide loading feedback:
Loading spinner from lucide-react (Loader2 icon with spin animation)
Disable textarea and button during generation
Show "Generating flashcards..." text
Success feedback:
Smooth transition to showing flashcard list
Keep input text visible so user can modify and regenerate
10. OpenRouter.ai Prompt Engineering

Craft precise system and user prompts:
System message defining the AI's role as a flashcard generator
User message with clear instructions to analyze text and extract 5-10 key concepts
Explicit format requirement: JSON array with exactly this structure: [{"question": "...", "answer": "..."}]
Instruction to make questions clear and self-contained
Instruction to make answers concise but complete
Request for diverse question types (definitions, explanations, applications)
Handle LLM response parsing:
Extract JSON from potential markdown code blocks
Validate that response is an array
Validate each item has question and answer properties
Generate unique IDs for each flashcard (using crypto.randomUUID or timestamp)
Handle cases where LLM returns fewer than 5 or more than 10 cards
11. Testing and Validation Scenarios

Verify complete user flow with test cases:
Short text (500 chars): Button should be disabled, show validation message
Valid text (2000 chars): Button enabled, generates 5-10 flashcards successfully
Long text (15000 chars): Button disabled, show validation message
Edge case (exactly 1000 chars): Button enabled, works correctly
Edge case (exactly 10000 chars): Button enabled, works correctly
Empty input: Button disabled
API failure simulation: Error message displays correctly
Multiple generations: Can generate, modify text, and regenerate
Page refresh: All state clears as expected

Summary
This updated plan incorporates all your specifications: GPT-3.5-turbo model via OpenRouter.ai, generation of 5-10 flashcards, and strict 1000-10000 character input validation. The implementation focuses on delivering a polished, user-friendly PoC that validates the core AI generation feature before expanding to additional functionality.

The character counter provides real-time feedback to guide users toward valid input. The validation layer prevents unnecessary API calls. The error handling ensures users receive clear, actionable feedback in all scenarios. The responsive design and professional styling create a production-ready appearance suitable for user testing and feedback collection.
