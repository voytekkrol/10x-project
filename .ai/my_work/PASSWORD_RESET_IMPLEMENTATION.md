# Password Reset Feature Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete password reset feature for your application using Supabase Auth. The implementation follows best practices and integrates seamlessly with your existing authentication system.

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Request Password Reset**
   - User clicks "Forgot password?" link on login page
   - User enters their email address on `/auth/forgot-password`
   - User clicks "Send Reset Link"
   - If email exists, Supabase sends a password reset email

2. **Email Confirmation**
   - User receives email from Supabase with reset link
   - Link contains authentication token in URL hash
   - User clicks link → redirected to `/auth/confirm`

3. **Token Exchange**
   - `/auth/confirm` page exchanges token for session (client-side)
   - Redirects to `/auth/reset-password` with active session

4. **Set New Password**
   - User enters and confirms new password
   - Password is validated (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
   - User submits form → password updated in Supabase
   - User redirected to login page

## Files Modified

### Components

1. **`src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx`**
   - Calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`
   - Validates email with Zod schema
   - Shows success message after sending reset link

2. **`src/components/auth/ResetPasswordForm.tsx`**
   - Calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })`
   - Validates password strength with Zod schema
   - Shows success message and redirects to login

### Pages

3. **`src/pages/auth/forgot-password.astro`**
   - Renders forgot password form
   - Checks if user is already authenticated
   - Redirects authenticated users to app

4. **`src/pages/auth/confirm.astro`**
   - Handles email confirmation and password reset tokens
   - Client-side script exchanges token for session
   - Redirects to appropriate page based on type:
     - `type=recovery` → `/auth/reset-password`
     - `type=signup` → `/auth/login?confirmed=true`

5. **`src/pages/auth/reset-password.astro`**
   - Renders reset password form
   - Validates user has active session from reset link
   - Redirects to forgot-password if no session

6. **`src/pages/auth/login.astro`**
   - Added success message for email confirmation
   - Added error messages for various failure cases
   - Removed duplicate environment variable script (now in layout)

### Layouts

7. **`src/layouts/Layout.astro`**
   - Added environment variables injection for browser client
   - Exposes `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` to `window.ENV`

8. **`src/layouts/AuthLayout.astro`**
   - Added environment variables injection for auth pages
   - Same as Layout.astro

### Middleware

9. **`src/middleware/index.ts`**
   - Updated to handle semi-protected paths
   - `/auth/reset-password` now allows users with temporary sessions
   - Doesn't redirect authenticated users from reset password page

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables

The implementation uses **SUPABASE_URL** and **SUPABASE_KEY** (not the PUBLIC_ versions) as requested. These are exposed to the browser client through:

```javascript
window.ENV = { SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY };
```

This is done in both `Layout.astro` and `AuthLayout.astro` to ensure all pages have access.

### Session Management

- Password reset creates a **temporary session** for the user
- This session is only valid for updating the password
- After password update, user must log in with new credentials
- Session is established in `/auth/confirm` via client-side token exchange

### Security Considerations

- All password validation uses Zod schemas
- Server-side validation in reset-password.astro checks for active session
- Client-side and server-side validation work together
- Supabase handles secure token generation and expiration

### Middleware Path Configuration

```typescript
// Public paths - no auth required, redirects authenticated users away
const PUBLIC_PATHS = ["/auth/login", "/auth/register", "/auth/forgot-password", "/auth/confirm"];

// Semi-protected - accessible with or without auth, no auto-redirect
const SEMI_PROTECTED_PATHS = ["/auth/reset-password"];
```

## Supabase Configuration Required

For this to work in production, you need to configure Supabase:

1. **Email Templates** (Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates)
   - Customize the "Reset Password" email template
   - The redirect URL should point to: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/confirm`

2. **Redirect URLs** (Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration)
   - Add `https://yourdomain.com/auth/confirm` to allowed redirect URLs
   - For local development: `http://localhost:4321/auth/confirm`

## Testing the Feature

### Local Development

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:4321/auth/login`

3. Click "Forgot password?"

4. Enter a valid user email (must exist in Supabase)

5. Check your email for the reset link

6. Click the link → should redirect through confirm → reset password page

7. Enter new password and submit

8. Should redirect to login → log in with new password

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Success Flow:**
- User receives "Check your email" message
- Email contains working reset link
- User can set new password
- User can log in with new password

❌ **Error Handling:**
- Invalid email → validation error shown
- Expired token → redirected to forgot-password with error
- Weak password → validation error shown
- Network errors → user-friendly error messages

## Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive console logging for debugging:

- `[Confirm] Auth callback - Type: ...` - Token exchange status
- `[Middleware] Path: ..., Session exists: ...` - Auth state
- Password reset request/update logs in form components

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Rate limiting for password reset requests
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Email notification when password is changed
- Password reset link expiration countdown
- "Remember me" functionality on login

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase configuration (URLs, templates)
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Check Supabase dashboard logs for API errors
