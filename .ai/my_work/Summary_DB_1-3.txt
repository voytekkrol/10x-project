Users table will include: id, email, encrypted_password, confirmed_at, created_at, updated_at, last_login, and deleted_at for GDPR compliance.
Flashcards table will have created_at, updated_at, and a source column with VARCHAR type storing values: "ai-full", "ai-edited", "manual".
One-to-many relationship between users and flashcards with no sharing capabilities.
MVP scope includes flashcard generation tracking via a Generations entity with fields: id (bigserial), user_id (FK), model, generated_count, accepted_unedited_count, accepted_edited_count, source_text_hash, source_text_length.
Generation errors will be stored in Generation_error_logs table with fileds: model, source_text_hash, source_text_length, error_code, error_message, created_at
Character limits: 200 characters for front field, 500 characters for back field.
Soft deletes implemented with deleted_at timestamp field in both users and flashcards tables.
Counter fields (generated_count, accepted_unedited_count, accepted_edited_count) use INTEGER data type.
SHA256 hashing for source_text_hash field.
User deletion preserves related generations and flashcards for statistical purposes, handled at application level.
No additional partial indexes, audit logging tables, model ENUM validation, or database views for MVP.
CHECK constraints implemented at database level for character limits.
Basic indexing on flashcards.user_id, generations.user_id, and composite indexes as recommended.
Repetition algorithm works independently without database metadata storage.
Partitioning and advanced performance monitoring features are out of MVP scope.

<matched_recommendations>
Include GDPR compliance fields in users table - ACCEPTED (implemented with specific column list including, last_login, deleted_at).
Use created_at and updated_at timestamps in flashcards table - ACCEPTED.
Implement source column for flashcard origin tracking - ACCEPTED (VARCHAR with CHECK constraints instead of ENUM).
One-to-many relationship between users and flashcards - ACCEPTED.
Generations entity for AI generation statistics tracking - ACCEPTED (with specified fields).
Soft deletes with deleted_at field - ACCEPTED.
INTEGER data type for counter fields - ACCEPTED.
SHA256 hashing for text deduplication - ACCEPTED.
Application-level handling of soft deletes - ACCEPTED (to preserve statistical data).
CHECK constraints for character limits - ACCEPTED.
Basic indexing strategy - ACCEPTED (applied all recommendations).
Independent repetition algorithm - ACCEPTED (no database metadata storage).
No partitioning for MVP - ACCEPTED.

<database_planning_summary>
The database planning conversation focused on creating a PostgreSQL schema for a flashcard learning application MVP using Supabase. Key requirements include user authentication, flashcard creation (manual and AI-generated), GDPR compliance, and statistics tracking.
Main requirements for the database schema:
Support user registration/login with GDPR-compliant data handling
Store flashcards with front/back content, creation metadata, and source tracking
Track AI generation sessions with statistics on acceptance rates
Implement soft deletes for data retention compliance
Ensure data isolation between users
Support efficient querying for user dashboards and statistics
Key entities and their relationships:
users: Core entity with authentication fields and GDPR compliance columns
flashcards: Contains question/answer content with user ownership and source metadata
generations: Tracks AI generation sessions with statistical counters
Relationships: users (1) → flashcards (many), users (1) → generations (many)
Important security and scalability concerns:
Row-level security to ensure users only access their own data
Soft deletes to maintain referential integrity while supporting GDPR deletion rights
SHA256 hashing for text deduplication to prevent duplicate processing
Character limits enforced at database level to prevent abuse
Indexing strategy focused on user-specific queries and statistics aggregation
Application-level handling of user deletion to preserve statistical data integrity
Database design decisions:
VARCHAR with CHECK constraints for categorical data instead of ENUMs
INTEGER counters for statistics (not SMALLINT) for future scalability
No audit logging or advanced performance monitoring in MVP scope
No table partitioning or materialized views for initial implementation
Independent spaced repetition algorithm with no database state management
